## Agenda

1. Discuss readings.
  
2. [A *Brief* History of the Internet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X4WGz1pM-7e_H3LYtLuXE6DOubdJWutSpBgix3B3Le0/edit?usp=sharing)

3. [HTML and CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rG2oAekaN15hVS_GesqGp1LwjEEdruYCZC5h1AhClXY/edit?usp=sharing)

4. [Git and project structure](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19DmXf-1datXVRUU6PS2C50UJBxhRgP00yiYArbY4g4g/edit?usp=sharing)

5. Set up your class GitHub repository and get GitHub Pages working. It should contain some information about yourself. You’ll be linking to your projects and anything else you want to from your class site over the length of this class, so don’t be afraid to get creative. Slack me your website.

6. Work individually, and then [sign up for time slots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKYC62G33C3cRihnkBeMfyp4AWqv8ZuU6QfkiJxL5ug/edit?usp=sharing) to meet together in groups of 4 to discuss your projects. Start by creating an `index.html` page for your project and setting up just semantic DOM. Then, when you feel it is in good place, start layering in some CSS. If you want to, include this [CSS reset](https://core-interaction.github.io/assets/styles/reset.css).

## For next week


* Read Paul Ford.

* Finish setting up your class site if you did not in class.

* Continue [Project 1](/projects/#project-1-world-as-source). Try to include some semantic HTML in your code. Your code for Project 1 should be located in the `project-1` folder of your class site and contain an `index.html` with the contents. Your class site should link to this.
