## Agenda
 
1. Final reviews. Add your website to your class site on GitHub — we’ll be presenting from my computer. Be prepared to talk for 5–10 minutes about the background of your project, the overall points of your essay, and finally your website. It would be great to hear about some of the decision making based on your source that led you to design your website the way you did.
